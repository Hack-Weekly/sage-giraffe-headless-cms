## Description:
A headless CMS is a content management system that focuses solely on managing and delivering content, decoupled from the presentation layer or "head" of a website or application. Unlike traditional CMS platforms, a headless CMS does not dictate how the content is displayed. Instead, it provides a back-end infrastructure and an API that allows content creators to organize, create, and edit content, while developers have the freedom to deliver that content to various front-end channels. Us here at Sage Giraffe have created this Headless CMS with the purpose of providing that layer for the user to create/update their content. 

## Functionality: 
For more details on how to use the API, please visit our website. There, we have a fully fleshed out page on how to use certain endpoints, as well as a documentation section that properly explains the possibilities of each part of our CMS.

## Features
